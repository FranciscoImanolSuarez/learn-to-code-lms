# Learn To Code

### What problems does it solve and how does it solve them?

After teaching a few of the Learn To Code Seattle classes, I saw an opportunity to improve the learning experience for the students, while also improving the teaching experience for the instructor. I decided to revamp the lessons and translate them from slide deck presentations to articles in a learning managment system.

I added text areas with text highlighting, indentation, and warnings so that students can write all of their code without leaving the application. I connected the student's code snippets to a code evaluator, so that they can see their code being run in real time. All of their code is auto-saved to a postgres database so that it is always there when they want to review it.

This makes both learning and teaching much more streamlined.

### Who has this problem?

Learn To Code is currently geared towards the intro classes and students. It is a great tool for someone that knows little to nothing about web development. In the future, I would like to incorporate advanced lessons, and a social aspect so that students and instructors can connect more easily.

### What web APIs does it use?

* The replit-client API for JavaScript evaluation
* The Cloud9 Ace Editor API for syntax highlighting, indentation, and code warnings.
* The Meetup API for Oauth and event registration.

### What technologies does it use?

* Babel
* Brunch
* CSS3
* Express
* Heroku
* HTML5
* Joi
* JS (ES6/2015)
* JSX
* Knex
* Material-UI
* Node.js
* Postgresql
* React
* Redux
* SASS
